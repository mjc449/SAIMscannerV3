This project has been developed in house by the Paszek and Zipfel labs
at Cornell University over a few years and several revisions.  The
primary developer has been Marshall Colville (mjc449@cornell.edu) with
assistance from Warren Zipfel and Matt Paszek.

Given the scope of the project, the multiple revisions and adaptations
that the hardware and software have gone through, and the fact that
we are not electrical or software engineers the code tends to change
styles and not follow typical conventions.  As the project evolves we
intend to bring everything into line with a single, consistent set of
coding guidelines.  However, to go through the entire project will take
some time.  We will publish a set of style guides soon to be used throughout
the project that reflects typical coding conventions.
